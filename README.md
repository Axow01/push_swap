# push_swap
## Description

This project is designed to help you understand sorting algorithms better. You will be given two stacks, named a and b, and your task is to sort them using only the provided actions. Once sorted, you must print the steps taken to sort the stacks in the standard output. The goal is to sort the stacks in the most efficient way possible, with fewer steps resulting in a better grade.
